CameraCTRL aims to ease camera settings setup for Minecraft machinimeers.

## How to use it?
* Setup your FOV and mouse sensitivity you want for your camera profile in the Minecraft settings
* Press Y to copy them (you can now go back to your usual settings you use to play)
* Press R at anytime to apply the saved settings you copied (GUI is hidden and cinematic mode enabled)
* If you press R once more, you recover the settings you had before pressing it.

## Is this mod useful?
Clearly not for everybody. I may plan on extending it to save even more settings in the future, however for the usage it is meant to be used, this would be useless. I got bored of always changing plenty of settings to just switch to a camera shoulder-like shot when I am recording machinimas, so I binded it all to one key.

## Do I need it on my server?
Yes. This mod **does need** to be installed on the server if you use one.
